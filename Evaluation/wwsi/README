WWSI dataset presented in paper "Breaking Sticks and Ambiguities with Adaptive Skip-gram".

wwsi.txt -- the dataset used in paper, for each word the context width is equal to 10 words.
wwsi-full.txt -- the raw version of the dataset. Here we did not delete the punctuation
marks, we also collected the contexts of width 60.

The format is the following:

<TITLE_OF_WORD_PAGE><TAB><WORD><TAB><NUMBER_OF_INPUT_LINKS><TAB><NUMBER_OF_MEANINGS>
<TITLE_OF_MEANING1_PAGE><TAB><NUMBER_OF_INPUT_LINKS><TAB><NUMBER_OF_CONTEXTS>
<CONTEXT1_WORD_POSITION>
<CONTEXT1_WORDS>
<CONTEXT2_WORD_POSITION>
<CONTEXT2_WORDS>
...
<TITLE_OF_MEANING2_PAGE><TAB><NUMBER_OF_INPUT_LINKS><TAB><NUMBER_OF_CONTEXTS>
<CONTEXT1_WORD_POSITION>
<CONTEXT1_WORDS>
<CONTEXT2_WORD_POSITION>
<CONTEXT2_WORDS>
...
...
<TITLE_OF_WORD_PAGE><TAB><WORD><TAB><NUMBER_OF_INPUT_LINKS><TAB><NUMBER_OF_MEANINGS>
...
...

Each collected word is described by four attributes:
    TITLE_OF_WORD_PAGE -- raw title of Wikipedia page related to this word
    WORD -- word
    NUMBER_OF_INPUT_LINKS -- number of input Wikipedia links
    NUMBER_OF_MEANINGS -- number of collected meanings for this word
After this desription meanings (of this word) with their contexts are enumerated.
Each meanings is described by three attributes:
    TITLE_OF_MEANING1_PAGE -- raw title of Wikipedia page related to the first meaning
of current word
    NUMBER_OF_INPUT_LINKS -- number of input Wikipedia links
    NUMBER_OF_CONTEXTS -- number of sample contexts for this meaning
Finally we enumerate the contexts, related to current meaning. Each contexts is described by:
    CONTEXT1_WORD_POSITION -- the position of the word in the list of context words
(for the first context)
    CONTEXT1_WORDS -- list of context words (may be with punctuation marks depending on
the state of COLLECT_RAW_TEXT flag in source code)
