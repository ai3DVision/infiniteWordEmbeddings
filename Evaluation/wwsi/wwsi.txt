library the value of a is the reuse of the

when a program invokes a it gains the behavior implemented

the behavior implemented inside that without having to implement that 
5
the behavior implemented by a can be connected to the 
5
if the code of the is accessed during the build

the invoking program then the is called a static library 
5
library is called a static an alternative is to build

distribute that independently from the implementation the library behavior is

from the library implementation the behavior is connected after the

execution in this case the is called a dynamic library

sammet described them as inadequate facilities in retrospect another major 
5
major contributor to the modern concept came in the form 
5
classes could be included in files and added at compile 
5
as links or symbols to modules the linking process is

used and code in a that is never actually used

all can exclude floating point routines this smart linking feature

meaning that references to the modules are resolved and the

linking involves a dynamically linked loading and unloading at run

Prime number	1055	231
1
a number or a prime is 
5
a prime number or a is a natural number greater 
5
1 that is not a number is called a composite 
5
number for example 5 is because 1 and 5 are 
5
requires excluding 1 as a because one can include arbitrarily 
5
3 the property of being or not is called primality 
5
mersenne numbers the largest known number has 17 425 170 
5
sets apart all of the numbers from composites however the 
5
in that direction is the number theorem proven at the 
5
given randomly chosen number is is inversely proportional to its 
5
of n many questions regarding numbers remain open such as 
5
two primes and the twin conjecture that there are infinitely 
5
factoring large numbers into their factors prime numbers give rise 
5
numbers into their prime factors numbers give rise to various 
5
domains mainly algebra such as elements and prime ideals definition 
5
such as prime elements and ideals definition and examples a 
5
6 etc is called a number or a prime if 
5
a prime number or a if it has exactly two 
5
than 1 that are not are called composite among the 
5
3 and 5 are the numbers while 1 4 and 
5
4 and 6 are not 1 is excluded as a 
5
1 is excluded as a number for reasons explained below 
5
explained below 2 is a number since the only natural 
5
and 2 next 3 is too 1 and 3 do 
5
remainder 1 thus 3 is however 4 is composite since 
5
without remainder 5 is again none of the numbers 2 
5
since hence 6 is not the image at the right 
5
illustrates that 12 is not no even number greater than 
5
number greater than 2 is because by definition any such 
5
this implies that is not accordingly the term odd prime 
5
prime accordingly the term odd refers to any prime number 
5
odd prime refers to any number greater than 2 in 
5
in a similar vein all numbers bigger than 5 written 
5
the condition of being a can also be restated as 
5
restated as a number is if it is greater than 
5
same is a number is if it can not be 
5
thanš1 in other words is if items can not be 
5
denoted by the first 168 numbers all the prime numbers 
5
168 prime numbers all the numbers less than 1000 are 
5
arithmetic the crucial importance of numbers to number theory and 
5
for the order of the factors primes can thus be 
5
in this example the same factor may occur multiple times 
5
a number into finitely many factors to is called prime 
5
prime factors to is called factorization of the fundamental theorem 
5
so albeit there are many factorization algorithms to do this 
5
same result if is a number and divides a product 
5
proofs of the uniqueness of factorizations primality of one most 
5
did not consider it a in the 19th century however 
5
consider the number 1 a for example derrick norman lehmer 
5
with 1 as its first henri lebesgue is said to 
5
professional mathematician to call 1 although a large body of 
5
valid when calling 1 a the fundamental theorem of arithmetic 
5
1 were admitted as a these two presentations would be 
5
different factorizations of 15 into numbers so the statement of 
5
if 1 were considered a a modified version of the 
5
sieve that considers 1 as would eliminate all multiples of 
5
the single numberš1 furthermore the numbers have several properties that 
5
they had some knowledge of numbers the egyptian fraction expansions 
5
of the explicit study of numbers come from the ancient 
5
perfect number from a mersenne the sieve of eratosthenes attributed 
5
happened with the study of numbers until the 17th century 
5
the form 22nš š1 are they are called fermat numbers 
5
is composite one of its factors isš641 as euler discovered 
5
numbers are known to be the french monk marin mersenne 
5
− š1 with p a they are called mersenne primes 
5
second factor is a mersenne at the start of the 
5
to a proof of the number theorem this outline was 
5
poussin who independently proved the number theorem in 1896 proving 
5
1896 proving a number is is not done for large 
5
slower for a long time numbers were thought to have 
5
cryptography were invented in which numbers formed the basis of 
5
circles the great internet mersenne search and other distributed computing 
5
theory of primes number of numbers there are infinitely many 
5
numbers there are infinitely many numbers another way of saying 
5
is that the sequence of numbers never ends this statement 
5
divisible by at least one number it is possible that 
5
possible that n itself is none of the primes by 
5
set initially considered contains all numbers leading to a contradiction 
5
grow only until the biggest p is reached the growth 
5
to infinity in this sense numbers occur more often than 
5
a given number n is the most basic routine trial 
5
only tell whether n is or not routines also yielding 
5
also yielding one or all factors of n are called 
5
then n is not a otherwise it is a prime 
5
prime otherwise it is a indeed if is composite with 
5
divides 37 so 37 is this routine can be implemented 
5
for those m that are for example to check the 
5
n increases according to the number theorem explained below the 
5
explained below the number of numbers less than is approximately 
5
division method is called a number sieve the oldest example 
5
whether a given number is or not for example trial 
5
it will always identify a number as prime and a 
5
identify a prime number as and a composite number as 
5
prove that a number is these tests rely on testing 
5
time if applied to a number but pass only with 
5
sure that the number is on the other hand if 
5
n if p is a number if we have a 
5
even though they are not so the test has no 
5
no way of distinguishing between numbers and carmichael numbers carmichael 
5
numbers are substantially rarer than numbers though so this test 
5
erroneously report composite numbers as in practice the fastest such 
5
table lists a number of tests the running time is 
5
algorithms and the largest known in addition to the aforementioned 
5
requires the knowledge of the factors of while the lucas 
5
lehmer primality test needs the factors of as input for 
5
applied to check whether are prime numbers of this form 
5
to check whether are prime numbers of this form are 
5
form 2p 1 with p primorial primes fermat primes and 
5
and mersenne primes that is numbers that are of the 
5
where p is an arbitrary the lucas lehmer test is 
5
is why the largest known has almost always been a 
5
almost always been a mersenne since the dawn of electronic 
5
all such numbers fk are this was based on the 
5

waves are described by a equation which sets out how

depending on the type of there are two main types

in the direction of the the second main type of 
5
the second main type of electromagnetic waves do not require 
5
movement in gravitational fields a can be transverse or longitudinal 
5
encompassing definition for the term is not straightforward a vibration 
5
vibration is not necessarily a an attempt to define the 
5
phenomenon to be called a results in a fuzzy border 
5
fuzzy border line the term is often intuitively understood as 
5
as a whole in a the energy of a vibration 
5
is problematic for a standing for example a wave on 
5
standing wave for example a on a string where energy 
5
target is the key to detection and practical applications there 
5
to mention only a few phenomena it may appear that 
5
each specific instance of a process for example acoustics is 
5
mechanical rather than an electromagnetic transfer caused by vibration concepts 
5
acoustic as distinct from optic processes this difference in origin 
5
difference in origin introduces certain characteristics particular to the properties 
5
all waves for such reasons theory represents a particular branch 
5
concerned with the properties of processes independently of their physical

5
local water depth although arbitrary shapes will propagate unchanged in 
5
presence of dispersion the sine is the unique shape that 
5
exhibits loss so the sine propagating in a dispersive medium 
5
is periodic so the sine or sinusoid has a wavelength

strategy and not a pure significance in his famous paper 
5
equilibria into two types pure nash equilibria are nash equilibria 
5
are playing pure strategies mixed nash equilibria are equilibria where 
5
player is playing a mixed while nash proved that every 
5
equilibrium not all have pure nash equilibria for an example 
5
many games do have pure nash equilibria e g the 
5
games can have both pure and mixed strategy equilibria a 
5
both pure strategy and mixed equilibria a disputed meaning during 
5
the agents chooses a pure and the payoff depends on 
5
fraction of agents choosing each the mixed strategy hence represents 
5
choosing each strategy the mixed hence represents the distribution of 
5
equally likely to play each this interpretation weakens the predictive 
5
to actually play a pure of rock ever since game 
5
players randomize their decisions behavior while a mixed strategy assigns 
5
behavior strategy while a mixed assigns a probability distribution over 
5
over pure strategies a behavior assigns at each information set 
5
form games roughly a mixed randomly chooses a deterministic path 
5
game tree while a behavior can be seen as a 
5
any player and any mixed there exists a behavior strategy

is 6 and so its at is more generally a

similar computation shows that the of the squaring function at

a function to have a it is necessary for the

any continuous functions have a at even one point the

at even one point the as a function let be

a function that has a at every point in the

the notation for the nth of with respect to x

for multiple applications of the operator for example with leibniz

notation we can write the of y at the point

5
wish to talk about the as being a function itself

5
derivative rules to take the and solve for here is

velocity in other words the of f x with respect 
5
f to give the first df the second derivative is 
5
first derivative df the second is denoted d2f and the 
5
denoted d2f and the nth is denoted dnf if is 
5
equations rules of computation the of a function can in 
5
rules for basic functions most computations eventually require taking the 
5
computations eventually require taking the of some common functions the 
5
example if then and the function is defined only for

if then computation example the of is here the second

so the above definition of applies to them the derivative 
5
derivative applies to them the of y t is defined 
5
vectors not scalars if the of y exists for every 
5
if we assume that the of a vector valued function 
5
the linearity property then the of y t must be 
5
at time t then the y艂 t is the velocity 
5
consequently the definition of the for a function of one 
5
direction this is the partial of f with respect to 
5
rounded d called the partial symbol to distinguish it from 
5
dee in general the partial of a function in the

case f has a partial ∂ f ∂ xj with

choose a vector the directional of f in the direction

compute or estimate the directional after changing the length of

then they determine the directional of f in the direction

the definition of the total it follows that the directional 
5
it follows that the directional is linear in v meaning 
5
in this case the directional is a vector in rm 
5
a vector in rm total total differential and jacobian matrix 
5
to rm then the directional of f in a chosen 
5
but when no single directional can give a complete picture 
5
behavior of f the total also called the total differential 
5
just like the single variable is chosen so that the 
5
are both one then the is a number and the 
5
is small and that the varies continuously in a then 
5
since we define the total by taking a limit as 
5
variable the fact that the is the best linear approximation 
5
the domain rn furthermore the is a linear transformation a 
5
formula for the one variable in which these problems disappear 
5
the usual definition of the may be manipulated to show 
5
manipulated to show that the of f at a is 
5
the definition of the total of f at a therefore 
5
sometimes written if the total exists at a then all 
5
all v is the directional of f in the direction 
5
so that then the total can be expressed using the 
5
the existence of the total f ′ a is strictly 
5
are continuous then the total exists is given by the 
5
the definition of the total subsumes the definition of the 
5
subsumes the definition of the in one variable that is 
5
real variable then the total exists if and only if 
5
and only if the usual exists the jacobian matrix reduces 
5
whose only entry is the f艂 x this 1 × 
5
f at a the total of a function does not

this is because the total of a multivariable function has 
5
much more information than the of a single variable function

variable function instead the total gives a function from the

5
the question of what causes and what effect it has 
5
as to the causes of most can be divided into 
5
broad areas quality theories of and quantity theories of inflation 
5
inflation and quantity theories of the quality theory of inflation 
5
inflation the quality theory of rests on the expectation of 
5
buyer the quantity theory of rests on the quantity equation 
5
proposed a quantity theory of for money and a quality 
5
and a quality theory of for production currently the quantity 
5
as an accurate model of in the long run consequently 
5
in the long run the rate is essentially dependent on 
5
the short and medium term may be affected by supply 
5
affect prices and that visible is the result of pressures 
5
are three major types of as part of what robert 
5
the triangle model demand pull is caused by increases in 
5
and government spending etc demand encourages economic growth since the 
5
investment and expansion cost push also called supply shock inflation 
5
inflation also called supply shock is caused by a drop 
5
prices can cause cost push producers for whom oil is 
5
times of recession built in is induced by adaptive expectations 
5
prices above the rate of and firms passing these higher 
5
a vicious circle built in reflects events in the past 
5
might be seen as hangover demand pull theory states that 
5
demand pull theory states that accelerates when aggregate demand increases 
5
increases aggregate demand can cause however in the long run 
5
the effect of money on is most obvious when governments 
5
in determining moderate levels of although there are differences of 
5
the money supply in determining that is for keynesians the 
5
production a fundamental concept in analysis is the relationship between 
5
analysis is the relationship between and unemployment called the phillips 
5
employment therefore some level of could be considered desirable in 
5
describe the combination of rising and economic stagnation sometimes referred 
5
1970s thus modern macroeconomics describes using a phillips curve that 
5
so the trade off between and unemployment changes because of 
5
matters as supply shocks and becoming built into the normal 
5
the economy normally suffers from thus the phillips curve represents 
5
corresponds to the non accelerating rate of unemployment nairu or 
5
nairu the theory says that will accelerate as suppliers increase 
5
their prices and built in worsens if gdp falls below 
5
unemployment is above the nairu will decelerate as suppliers attempt 
5
prices and undermining built in however one problem with this 
5
tends to change over time also seems to act in 
5
into the realm of accelerating unemployment a connection between inflation 
5
inflation unemployment a connection between and unemployment has been drawn 
5
unemployment rate generally only affects in the short term but 
5
is far more predictive of than low unemployment in marxian 
5
of labor which restrain wage in the 20th century similar 
5
include the nairu non accelerating rate of unemployment and the 
5
the most significant factor influencing or deflation is how fast 
5
taxation as ineffective in controlling the monetarist economist milton friedman 
5
economist milton friedman famously stated is always and everywhere a 
5
of monetary history shows that has always been a monetary 
5
of increase in prices the rate is equal to the 
5
and strategies are important for as well a core assertion 
5
that fulfill predictions of higher this means that central banks 
5
establish their credibility in fighting or economic actors will make 
5
at the expense of exacerbating thus if a central bank 
5
reputation as being soft on when it announces a new 
5
a new policy of fighting with restrictive monetary growth economic 
5
remain high and so will on the other hand if 
5
reputation of being tough on then such a policy announcement 
5
come down rapidly thus allowing itself to come down rapidly 
5
the austrian school stresses that is not uniform over all 
5
all assets goods and services depends on differences in markets 
5
ludwig von mises said that should refer to an increase 
5
for money and that price will necessarily follow real bills

earlier scandinavia monetary union controlling a variety of methods and

5
some banks have a symmetrical target while others only control 
5
target while others only control when it rises above a 
5
and within a targeted annual range of about 2 to 
5
central bankers target a low rate because they believe deflation 
5
use monetary policy to control by increasing interest rates and 
5
demand during recessions to keep stable control of aggregate demand 
5
as a means to control however as the value of

this essentially means that the rate in the fixed exchange

5
an important example of such is the invariance of the

5
is said to exhibit spherical a rotation about any axis 
5
invariance when discussing observed physical this can be applied to 
5
is said to exhibit cylindrical because the electric field strength 
5
global or local a global is one that holds at 
5
of spacetime whereas a local is one that has a 
5
one that has a different transformation at different points of 
5
of spacetime specifically a local transformation is parameterised by the 
5
the two examples of rotational described above spherical and cylindrical 
5
are each instances of continuous these are characterised by invariance 
5
a sphere has proper rotational other types of spatial rotations 
5
described in the article rotation poincaré transformations these are spatio
